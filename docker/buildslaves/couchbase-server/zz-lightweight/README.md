** DEPRECATED **
----------------

This contains the Dockerfile for couchbasebuild/zz-lightweight, which is
used by the `zz-lightweight` agent on server.jenkins (and possibly some
others).

We're converting all jobs to use `zzz-lightweight` instead, which is
using the couchbasebuild/zzz-lightweight image. So this image is
considered *deprecated*.
