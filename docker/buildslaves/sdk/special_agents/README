Two agents need to be started outside of the swarm so that they can be
run with --privileged. There is a job,

http://sdk.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/recreate-special-agent/

which handles starting these agents from their :latest tags. They are
currently launched on sdk-swarm-01.build.couchbase.com. That host must
have files

    /home/couchbase/SPECIAL_SLAVES/jenkins_master_username
    /home/couchbase/SPECIAL_SLAVES/jenkins_master_password

containing the same data as the like-named secrets on the SDK
Docker swarm.
