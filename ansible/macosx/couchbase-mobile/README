Setup Mobile MACOS

Prereq

1. Setup a mac agent on mobile jenkins https://mobile.jenkins.couchbase.com using JNLP connection.
   Make a note of the agent's name and jnlp secret. These are required when running the ansible
   command at step 6 & 7.
2. Create a new Mac VM and install appropriate version of xcode as needed. VM ova and iso might be
   available on latestbuild. If not, it will need to be downloaded from https://developer.apple.com

Deploy tools via ansible

1. git clone https://github.com/couchbase/build.git
2. cd build/ansible/macosx/couchbase-mobile
3. Download MacOS codesign cert, from lastpass. unzip it to files directory so that it becomes
   files/Certificates.p12
4. Ensure a copy of the following file in ssh directory
   buildbot_id_dsa
   config
   id_ns-codereview
   id_rsa
   ns-buildbot.rsa
   patch_via_gerrit.ini
5. Ensure a copy of jenkins-appledeveloper.developerprofile in files directory
   info is in team's lastpass database
6. update inventory information
7. Run the playbook and enter sudo password
   % ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --ask-become-pass

NOTES:

- Starting from xcode 16.3, Xcode Test Manager requires GUI access.
  Jenkins agent must be launched from a GUI session:
  - connect to VM via vnc
  - open a terminal window
  - cd ~/jenkins; ./jnlp.sh

  It is possible to automate this by adding jnlp.sh as a login item. However, performance
  is noticeably degraded.
